I hear you, I feel you
I know that you're out there somewhere
I'm waiting I'm searching
It's time for you to show yourself

I know you're waiting on the other side
I can almost reach you now

Like a scar on my heart
You will never ever go away you're here to stay
All my world fell apart the moment you
Disappeared
Show yourself
My dearest fear

I want you, I need you
You're the one that keeps me alive
I try to control you
But I can never win

I know you're waiting on the other side
I can almost reach you now

Like a scar on my heart
You will never ever go away you're here to stay
All my world fell apart the moment you
Disappeared
Show yourself
My dearest fear

I know you're waiting on the other side
I can almost reach you now

Like a scar on my heart
You will never ever go away you're here to stay
All my world fell apart the moment you
Disappeared
Show yourself
My dearest fear
